# English Grammar Checker using LL(1) Parser

## Overview
This project implements a simple LL(1) parser to validate basic English sentences. It includes a Tkinter-based GUI where users can enter a sentence and check its grammatical correctness.

## Features
- Uses an LL(1) parser to validate sentences.
- Supports basic English sentence structures like:
  - **Subject + Verb + Object** (e.g., *The boy eats an apple.*)
  - **Subject + Verb** (e.g., *The dog runs.*)
- Built with Python and Tkinter.

## Run it locally and the ll1 based grammar checker will pop up to use.
